\title{Integrate differential gene set calculated by all enrichment score matrixes}
\usage{
irGSEA.integrate(
  object = NULL,
  group.by = NULL,
  metadata = NULL,
  col.name = NULL,
  method = c("AUCell", "UCell", "singscore", "ssgsea"),
  p.value = "p_val_adj"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat object including enrichment score matrixes.}

\item{group.by}{Default ident when it set to NULL. You can specify other
columns of metadata.}

\item{metadata}{A vector add to this Seurat object, and then it is set as
the ident of Seurat object to perform differential gene sets analysis.}

\item{col.name}{A name for metadata.}

\item{method}{A vector to select enrichment score matrixes. Default all
enrichment score matrixes}

\item{p.value}{p_val_adj or p_val. The gene sets with statistical significance
in different scoring methods were filtered based on the p_val_adj or p_val
and then RRA analysis was performed. Default p_val_adj.}
}
\value{
A list including the differential gene sets calculated by enrichment
score matrixes through wlicox test. Gene sets with adjusted p value < 0.05
are regarded as statistically significant. Meanwhile, significant differential
gene sets are integrated and the results are saved in a data frame named RRA.
 Among them, Gene sets with p value < 0.05 are statistically significant and
 common differential in all gene sets enrichment analysis methods.
}
\description{
Wlicox test is perform to all enrichment score matrixes and gene sets with
adjusted p value < 0.05 are used to integrated through RRA.
